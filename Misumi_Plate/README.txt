Customizable Plate Bracket for Aluminium Extrusion Profiles (Misumi 2020, 2040, 4040, ...) by mightynozzle is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial license.

# Summary

This is a customizable thing that allows you to create and print aluminum extrusion plate brackets for different types and sizes of extrusion profiles.

I've also added the 21 brackets for 2020 and for the short side of the 2040 profile as .stl files.

If you need some hammer nuts with a good value for money, I can highly recommend these ones: [hammer nuts](https://goo.gl/Ub1AQ1)
I used the Drillpro M5 hammer nuts for my AM8.
They also offer some cheap [2020 aluminium extrusion profiles](https://goo.gl/EZbDFN)

This thing was mentioned on hackaday: https://hackaday.com/2017/12/16/if-3d-printer-then-custom-aluminum-extrusion-brackets/

#####Aluminium Extrusion Series
This is part of my [Aluminium Extrusions series](https://www.thingiverse.com/mightynozzle/collections/aluminium-extrusion). Follow me, if you want to be informed about a new part of this series!

####Customizable Settings
Use the Customizer or OpenSCAD to create your own customized set of brackets.

You only need to set these few parameters to get all the 21 brackets automatically: 
- width of mounting side of the extrusion profile (20mm for 2020 profile)
- length and thickness of the bracket
- number of rails (2020 has 1, 2040 has 1 and 2 rails)
- screw hole settings

You can also use the OpenSCAD file as a library (e.g. if you want create a whole printer in OpenSCAD). Check out the description in the head of the file.
